# Deep Learning Web Studio

Here is the rest of a former project which was a web studio for creating neural networks as a service.

I kept only the graphic part in order to make it a purely educational tool.

This tool can be used as a support for teaching the basics of deep learning.

It uses my own [graphic library](https://github.com/nokia/BYONND) to design and draw neural networks.
